About this version
------------------

This is an homemade conversion from Type 1 to OpenType. In fact, it wasn't a conversion, buta fight! 50 font files, 50 font names, 50 menu items totally cryptic, meaningless, absolutely un-understandable, like "Fishmonger EES Plain" or "Fishmonger ECT Italic".

Well, look at the two screenshots: this archive is the proof that, with the OpenType fonts, you can have meaningful files and fonts names and well ordered menus in Word and in InDesign, on the PC and on the Mac at the same time. In InDesign, you can have the 50 fonts in one perfectly ordered submenu, on the PC like on the Mac, and even in WinWord you can have a good font menu with 25 fonts (you use the Word style to get the italic fonts, italic is the only style to use, don"t use bold).

And you can have documents wich remains compatible between various applications and between various platforms: if you open a Mac Word document with these Fishmonger fonts in InDesign PC, it works.
